## Info about the Website Coding
The Website was generated using Quarto (an expanded markdown language). You can 
use HTML and CSS elements inside Quarto Markdown documents.

The landing page code can be found at 'index.qmd'. Each subpage has it's own
folder where individual 'index.qmd' files are located. 

For the CSS styling, you can find a file in 'html/styles.scss'. Github allows
only one styles file. The style file is connected to each index.qmd in it's
header.

Text formatting was done with HTML instead of using markdown basic features.
