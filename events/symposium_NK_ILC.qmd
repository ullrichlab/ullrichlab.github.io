The [NK/ILC Symposium](https://www.nk-ilc-symposium2024.com/) traditionally takes place in Germany each year, initiated by the Study Group "NK cells and ILCs" of the [German Society for Immunology (DGFI)](https://dgfi.org/arbeitskreise/ak-nk-zellen-und-ilcs/).

The meeting will bring together experts in innate lymphocyte biology, and cover the latest emerging concepts in the field, their clinical translation, and the application of cutting-edge high-resolution technologies. The meeting will host researchers, industrials, and clinicians with a common interest in NK cells and ILCs. It will discuss how the current understanding of the development and biology of NKs and ILCs might enable development of next-generation therapies in cancer and chronic infections.
